extensible_calculator is a simple python class that allows you to 
perform calculations on integers. It is written to be extensible
so that you can specify new operands besides the default few
provided here.

Results are returned as a list of ints, even if only one
expression is calculated.

Example:

from Calculator import Calculator

c = Calculator()

# Simple addition
c.calculate('3 + 5')

[8]

# Multiple expressions, separated via comma
c.calculate('3 + 5 * 12, 4 / 2 * 25')

[63, 50]
